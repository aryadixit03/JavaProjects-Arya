# JavaProjects-Arya
I began learning Java using the JGrasp IDE. The files here include some of the java projects I have completed. 
These projects here range from simple to complex, from square root or tax/investmenent calculators to more difficult games.
The final/largest project I completed was an "Ultimate Game" project, the file is labelled UltimateGame<Arya> which can be found in these files,
which uses different types of loops, methods, arrays, switch/cases, etc. to run.
